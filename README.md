To analyze global terrorism data with Python and Power BI, we can break the task into the following key steps:

## 1. Data Cleaning (Python - Pandas/Dask):
### Load the Data: 
Use Pandas or Dask (for large datasets) to load the terrorism dataset (e.g., the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)).
### Handling Missing Values: 
Identify and fill or drop missing values appropriately.
### Data Type Conversion: 
Convert data types to ensure efficient processing (e.g., converting date columns to datetime, categorical data to category).
### Feature Selection: 
Select relevant features for analysis (e.g., country, attack type, weapon type, casualties).
### Outlier Detection: 
Detect and handle outliers, which may involve capping, removal, or transformation.
### Data Normalization/Standardization: 
Normalize or standardize data if required for specific analyses.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python - Matplotlib, Seaborn):
### Univariate Analysis: 
Plot distributions of key variables (e.g., frequency of attacks by year, most common attack types).
### Bivariate Analysis: 
Analyze relationships between variables (e.g., correlation between attack types and casualties).
### Time Series Analysis: 
Plot trends over time (e.g., number of attacks per year).
### Geospatial Analysis: 
Plot the geographical distribution of attacks (using libraries like geopandas or folium).

## 3. Data Visualization (Power BI + Plotly):
### Interactive Dashboards: 
Import cleaned data into Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
### Map Visualization: 
Use Power BI to create maps showing the global distribution of terrorist attacks.
### Time Series Charts: 
Plot trends over time using line charts or area charts.
### Categorical Analysis: 
Use bar charts, pie charts, and treemaps for categorical data.
### Advanced Visualization (Plotly): 
If you need more interactive or customized visualizations, integrate Pythonâ€™s Plotly library with Power BI for advanced plots.
### Custom Visuals: 
Create Plotly visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, 3D plots) and embed them into Power BI dashboards.

## 4. Report Generation:
### Summary Report: 
Use Power BI to generate a summary report showcasing key insights and visualizations.
### Shareable Dashboard: 
Publish the Power BI dashboard for stakeholders, allowing them to interact with the data.
